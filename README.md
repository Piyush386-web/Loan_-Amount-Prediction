ðŸš€ *My Data Science Journey: From HR Analytics to Loan Amount Prediction* ðŸš€

After successfully completing my HR analytics project, I embarked on a new challenge: predicting loan amounts using supervised machine learning. This project allowed me to delve deeper into the intricacies of data science and machine learning. Hereâ€™s a glimpse into the steps I followed:

1. *Importing Necessary Libraries*: Utilized powerful tools like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to handle data efficiently and visualize insights.
2. *Loading the Dataset*: Leveraged Pandas to load and manipulate the dataset seamlessly.
3. *Performing Data Analysis*: Used Pandas functions such as head(), tail(), describe(), and isnull().sum() to understand the data structure and identify missing values.
4. *Dealing with Missing Values*: Implemented KNN Imputer to effectively manage missing data.
5. *Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*: Uncovered patterns and relationships within the data through EDA.
6. *Outlier Detection and Data Cleaning*: Identified and managed outliers, dropping unnecessary columns to refine the dataset.
7. *Correlation Analysis*: Used Seabornâ€™s heatmap to examine correlations between variables using the Spearman method.
8. *Data Preprocessing*: Employed scikit-learn for preprocessing tasks to prepare the data for modeling.
9. *Handling Outliers*: Ensured outliers were appropriately managed to enhance model accuracy.
10. *Data Modeling*: Split the data into training and testing sets to build robust models.
11. *Model Training*: Applied various machine learning models to predict the loan amount (dependent variable).
12. *Result*: Identified the most suitable model for loan amount prediction after thorough validation.

This project has been a significant milestone in my data science journey, enhancing my skills and knowledge in machine learning. I'm excited to continue exploring and contributing to the field of data science!
